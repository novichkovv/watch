                    [content] => <p><em>Here They Lie</em> is a psychological horror game for PlayStation VR and PlayStation 4 with a trailer that makes about as much (or little) sense as its announcement <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/06/13/here-they-lie-announced-a-surreal-horror-experience-for-ps-vr-ps4/">blog post</a> — which was posted by Cory Davis, the Co-Creative Director of the game and part of the game development studio Tangentlemen. Nonetheless, the studio employs some pretty experienced players who have taken the risk of going away from triple-a game development and start their own studio.</p>
<p>Psychological horror often comes with disturbing scenery, and this game doesn’t look like it’s breaking away from that formula. But this game incorporates that formula into virtual reality, and that is something worth getting excited over. Atmospheric games are well suited to VR, as they focus on audio and lighting, and on surprising the player in different ways. Horror is a great stage for this type of work, where every component adds to the immersive experience.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kojima-death-stranding-trailer/">First trailer of Hideo Kojima’s new game features Norman Reedus</a></p>
<p>The game has been developed in collaboration with Sony’s External Development team at Santa Monica Studio. Davis describes it as a “dark psychological horror experience that transports you to a terrifying, surreal world inhabited by strange and malevolent creatures.” Perhaps he’s referring to the creepy deer. He continues, “Unimaginable horrors lurk around every corner, just out of sight, haunting and infecting your mind.” Davis also says the game will force us to “confront the meaning” of our existence. Unlikely perhaps, but a worthwhile ambition. As such the game has a focus on narrative and dread.</p>
<p>Davis describes the birth of the new horror addition to PSVR as a rather confusing night in a Berlin techno club. Toby Gard, creator of Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider series, Rich Smith, who’s worked on the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare franchise, and John Garcia-Shelton, who’s worked on franchises like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty, somehow jointly arrived at the conclusion that they needed to make a game. That game became <em>Here They Lie</em>.</p>
<p><em>Here They Lie</em> is coming exclusively to PS4 and PSVR this fall.</p>

                    [content] => <p>Apple might have created its Live Photos image capture format, but that doesn’t mean others can’t make the most of it through third-party apps.</p>
<p>Recently, Google launched its latest photography-centric app, Motion Stills. Designed specifically for iOS, this app is meant to bring a slew of new features to Apple’s Live Photos format by improving the image capture and simplifying the process of sharing the resulting images.</p>
<p>Available for free in the iOS App Store, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motion-stills-create-live/id1086172168?ls=1&mt=8">Motion Stills</a> uses a clever collection of algorithms and AI to analyze the photos and data captured in the Live Photos format. Using this data and imagery, Motion Stills can process the Live Photos in a collection of creative ways.</p>
<p>Not only is Motion Stills able to stabilize the video captured before and after the still by processing the frames that are the most in-focus and detailed, it’s also capable of determining the best beginning and end point for the loop of the video.</p>
<p>Without so much as pressing a button, Motion Stills will automatically sort through your Live Photos and get all of the dirty work done behind the scenes. Below is an example clip of the stabilization feature in action:</p>
<div data-ratio="1.7778"><div><iframe height="100%" width="100%" allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unUNUKwGacY?feature=oembed"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Another problem Motion Stills covers is the lack of cross-platform support. Only recently have MacOS users been able to view Live Photos on their computers and Android support is all but nonexistent with the exception of a few third-party apps.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/apple-photo-ios-10-macos-sierra/">Apple is stepping up its Photo game with AI in iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra</a></p>
<p>Instead of relying on the unusual format, Motion Stills simplifies the process by letting you export the resulting movie clips as either a short video or animated GIF, both of which can be shared across almost any platform imaginable.</p>
<p>Apple will apparently address a few Live Photos issues in the upcoming iOS 10 update, such as Live Photos stabilization, but the video and GIF export options have yet to be mentioned at all. So, until then, it looks like Motion Stills is your best bet for making the most of your Live Photos.</p>

                    [content] => <p>Lasers, helicopters, hidden jungle cities, and ancient religions — it sounds like the synopsis to a Michael Crichton novel, but believe it or not, these things are actually the key components of some astonishing new archaeological research happening right here in the real world. With the help of an airborne lidar system, scientists recently managed to create a map of a long-lost city hidden beneath the jungle in Cambodia</p>
<p>With the special laser mounted on the underside of a helicopter, archeologists working on the project were able to compose maps revealing the massive scale of religious temples and other buildings belonging to the Khmer Empire, which was dominant in Southeast Asia from 802 AD until the 15th century. These maps were shown off for the first time this week at the Royal Geographic Society in London.</p>
<p><strong><a class="wp-image-985693" href="http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/figure_5-1449x1557.jpg"><span></span><img height="325" alt="Laser scanning map" width="303" class="wp-image-985693" src="http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/figure_5-303x325.jpg"></a>Related</strong>: <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/scanlab-self-driving-car-view/">This is what London looks like through a self-driving car’s eyes</a></p>
<p>Incredibly, the lidar system makes it possible to “look through” obstructing features such as trees and vegetation to map the ground underneath.</p>
<p>“Lidar is a revolutionary tool for archaeological survey on a landscape scale,” Dr. <a href="http://anth.uic.edu/uic-anthropology/people/faculty/mjhend">Mitch Hendrickson</a>, Assistant Professor, Department of Archaeology at the University of Chicago and a key partner in this project, told Digital Trends.</p>
<p>“The real impact of lidar is that it gives a detailed, accurate map of the ground that reveals features not clearly visible due to forest cover, or the archaeological features that leave only slight traces on the ground. It allows us to see the footprints of buildings, settlements and other infrastructure and how they intersect and change. This is the foundation for understanding community organization in the past.”</p>
<p>In short, lidar hits the “warp speed” button on painstaking archaeological work. A few hours of coverage with the groundbreaking tech achieves what literally decades of on-the-ground surveys would have been able to — and with far more accuracy to boot.</p>
<p>While it doesn’t carry out the actual excavation work itself, this is one piece of kit archaeologists are unlikely to want to leave home without from now on.</p>

<p>LONDON — Seventeen seconds. That's all the time it takes for the guy in the video below to lay out a wrap, add veggies and falafel, add sauce and then wrap the whole thing up ready to serve.</p>

<p>The following wrap was prepared at I-Falafel in Petticoat Lane, London. The price is £4 ($5.65) for a large, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/4nvmgw/the_fastest_falafel_wrapper_in_london/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But in this case it isn't about the wrap. It's about the speed.</p>
<div><p><iframe height="480" width="270" allowfullscreen src="https://vid.me/e/l2mh?stats=1&tools=1"></iframe></p></div>
<p>So at that speed he could get through at least three a minute, which is 180 an hour, which over an eight-hour day would be almost one-and-a-half thousand wraps. <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/14/speed-wrapping-falafel/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Read more...</a></p>

<p>LONDON — Seventeen seconds. That's all the time it takes for the guy in the video below to lay out a wrap, add veggies and falafel, add sauce and then wrap the whole thing up ready to serve.</p>
<div><p>SEE ALSO: <a data-crackerjax="#post-slider" href="http://mashable.com/2016/05/12/food-truck-side-hustle/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Young student runs a food truck, when she's not at school or work</a></p></div>
<p>The following wrap was prepared at I-Falafel in Petticoat Lane, London. The price is £4 ($5.65) for a large, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/4nvmgw/the_fastest_falafel_wrapper_in_london/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But in this case it isn't about the wrap. It's about the speed.</p>
<div><p><iframe height="480" width="270" allowfullscreen src="https://vid.me/e/l2mh?stats=1&tools=1"></iframe></p></div>
<p>So at that speed he could get through at least three a minute, which is 180 an hour, which over an eight-hour day would be almost one-and-a-half thousand wraps. <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/14/speed-wrapping-falafel/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Read more...</a></p>

<p>If you used Google today, you probably noticed that its <a href="http://www.google.com/">doodle</a> is dedicated to Karl Landsteiner, an immunologist and pathologist who was born in Vienna on June 14th, 1868 and would have turned 148 today. Even if you’ve never heard of Landsteiner, his discoveries have affected your medical records since you were born.</p>
<p>In 1901, Landsteiner classified human blood into different groups and created the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/science/ABO-blood-group-system">ABO blood group system</a> that we still use today. His discovery, which won him the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1930/landsteiner-bio.html">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930</a>, made blood transfusion a life-saving medical practice.</p>

<p>In the 1800s, doctors knew that transfusing blood between individuals could cause red blood cells to clump — a phenomenon called agglutination. But they didn’t know why. Landsteiner discovered that agglutination is a response of the immune system.</p>
<p>He found that different blood types have different antigens, substances that stimulate an immune response. Based on the antigens, Landsteiner classified the blood groups as type A, type B, and type O. (Type AB was identified in 1902 by two of Landsteiner’s colleagues.) If a person with type A blood is given type B blood, for example, the person’s immune system will recognize the new blood cells as foreign and reject them. This immune system reaction can be fatal.</p>
<p>His discovery and classification helped make blood transfusion safe. In 1922, Landsteiner moved to <a href="http://www.rockefeller.edu/about/awards/nobel/klandsteiner#sidebar">The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</a> in New York, where he continued his work on blood groups until his death in 1943.</p>

<p>This morning, the crew of the International Space Station <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-tv-to-broadcast-us-cargo-ship-departure-from-space-station-0">will say goodbye to Orbital ATK’s Cygnus cargo capsule</a>, which has been docked to the orbiting lab for the past two and a half months. To prep the vehicle’s departure, the station's Canadian robotic arm grabbed hold of the Cygnus earlier and undocked the capsule from the Unity module. The robotic arm will hold the capsule away from the station, and release the spacecraft at 9:30AM ET. The Cygnus — which has been filled up with around 3,000 pounds of station trash — will remain in orbit around Earth for about a week before it eventually burns up in the planet’s atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p><q><span>But NASA isn't done with the vehicle quite yet</span></q></p>
<p>Just because the capsule is leaving the station doesn’t mean NASA is done with the vehicle quite yet. About five hours after the Cygnus departs the ISS — and gets far enough away — a large blaze will ignite inside the capsule’s belly. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/16/11244364/nasa-saffire-test-fire-orbital-atk-cygnus-iss-resupply-mission">It’s all part of an experiment called Saffire-I</a> meant to study how fire behaves in microgravity. A cotton-fiberglass material measuring more than 3 feet long and 1 foot wide will burn for 15 to 20 minutes inside Cygnus, creating the largest controlled fire ever in space. A suite of onboard sensors and cameras will collect data about the blaze and relay that information to NASA over the next week. That info will help the space agency come up with better ways to detect fires in space, as well as figure out how to control flames in zero G.</p>
<p>Apart from housing this science experiment, Cygnus is also responsible for deploying a couple satellites after it leaves ISS. Tomorrow morning, the capsule will let go of five Lemur-2 satellites, manufactured by satellite-maker Spire Global. These satellites will help track ships traveling in remote areas of the world’s oceans, as well as monitor weather.</p>
<p>As for the Cygnus capsule, NASA will destroy it on June 22nd. That’s when the vehicle’s engines will fire twice, taking the spacecraft out of orbit and triggering its descent toward Earth. Cygnus will then burn up somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, effectively getting rid of all the trash it has on board. Those items include broken hardware from ISS, food containers, dirty laundry, and astronaut waste, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IBg6VheqA">according to Holly Vavrin</a>, the flight lead for the current Cygnus mission.</p>
<p>NASA will also be using the capsule’s fiery death plunge as an opportunity to study how vehicles break up during atmospheric reentry. Another payload onboard Cygnus, called the ReEntry Breakup Recorder, will be taking super quick measurements of the capsule’s temperature, speed, acoustics, and more as it falls to Earth. The recorder will then help rapidly relay that data to NASA scientists on the ground before it also burns up. This should help NASA understand how spacecraft enter Earth’s atmosphere, which could be useful when designing future vehicles.</p>
<p>Live coverage of the Cygnus departure begins at 9AM ET.</p>

<p>Politicians and regulators in the European Union are finding many instances of automakers using loopholes to circumvent emissions standards. Although so far only Volkswagen has been found using software to cheat the emissions tests specified by regulators, other automakers including Jeep, General Motors, and Mercedes-Benz are taking advantage of regulatory gray areas for diesel vehicles sold in the EU, according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/business/international/volkswagen-not-alone-in-flouting-pollution-limits.html?_r=0">a report from the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <em>Times</em> noted that EU regulations allow car makers to kill the emissions control system on diesel vehicles if there's a risk that running the emissions control system could cause engine damage—“which in some cases is nearly all the time,” the paper wrote.</p>
<p>Cold weather is often cited as a reason to deactivate emissions control in the interests of extending the life of the engine (car companies in the US <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/volkswagens-emissions-cheating-scandal-has-a-long-complicated-history/">used such a justification</a> against the accusations of environmentalists as early as the 70's). But a German study found a Jeep Cherokee sold by Fiat Chrysler in Europe turned off certain emissions controls when the car experienced temperatures as high as 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Recently, an independent investigation by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/gm-says-it-misstated-fuel-economy-opel-denies-emissions-cheating-allegations/">a German environmental lobbying group, the magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em>, and a German TV program called Monitor</a> found that Opel's Zafira was turning off emissions controls at high altitude and at speeds greater than 87 mph. Opel has denied that it's done anything illegal in designing its diesel cars.</p>

This video teaches you a few tips to get some amazing shots while you’re out and about.</p><p>For the unfamiliar, a photo walk is simply when you take your camera and stroll around looking for things to photograph. There’s no specific goal in mind, and there’s no set time when you’re done. It’s just to help you explore and practice. If you go with a group, it can be even better.</p><p>The video above from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn5C6P1rxY6PEU6xUKapbCQ">Cooperative of Photography</a> offers some helpful tips on how to get the most out of a photo walk. For example, using a remote control app for your camera can let you get pictures from new angles without drawing attention to yourself from the subject. Also, try to wear dark clothes to help you avoid standing out in a crowd.</p><p>Be sure you check out our guide on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5688057/know-your-rights-ten-misconceptions-about-photography-law">your rights as a photographer</a> before you head out. While taking your photos in public spaces is legal, it’s always possible someone will get uncomfortable and approach you. As the video also points out, having cards you can hand out can be a helpful way to interact with the people around you to not only make them feel more at ease, but possibly get new fans for your work.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/w4uUjLt22gE">23 Ninja Tips For Your Next Photo Walk</a> | COOPH</p><img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/lifehacker/vip/~4/RXU9WjD3TVY">

                            [content] => <p><em>Here They Lie</em> is a psychological horror game for PlayStation VR and PlayStation 4 with a trailer that makes about as much (or little) sense as its announcement <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/06/13/here-they-lie-announced-a-surreal-horror-experience-for-ps-vr-ps4/">blog post</a> — which was posted by Cory Davis, the Co-Creative Director of the game and part of the game development studio Tangentlemen. Nonetheless, the studio employs some pretty experienced players who have taken the risk of going away from triple-a game development and start their own studio.</p>
<p>Psychological horror often comes with disturbing scenery, and this game doesn’t look like it’s breaking away from that formula. But this game incorporates that formula into virtual reality, and that is something worth getting excited over. Atmospheric games are well suited to VR, as they focus on audio and lighting, and on surprising the player in different ways. Horror is a great stage for this type of work, where every component adds to the immersive experience.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kojima-death-stranding-trailer/">First trailer of Hideo Kojima’s new game features Norman Reedus</a></p>
<p>The game has been developed in collaboration with Sony’s External Development team at Santa Monica Studio. Davis describes it as a “dark psychological horror experience that transports you to a terrifying, surreal world inhabited by strange and malevolent creatures.” Perhaps he’s referring to the creepy deer. He continues, “Unimaginable horrors lurk around every corner, just out of sight, haunting and infecting your mind.” Davis also says the game will force us to “confront the meaning” of our existence. Unlikely perhaps, but a worthwhile ambition. As such the game has a focus on narrative and dread.</p>
<p>Davis describes the birth of the new horror addition to PSVR as a rather confusing night in a Berlin techno club. Toby Gard, creator of Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider series, Rich Smith, who’s worked on the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare franchise, and John Garcia-Shelton, who’s worked on franchises like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty, somehow jointly arrived at the conclusion that they needed to make a game. That game became <em>Here They Lie</em>.</p>
<p><em>Here They Lie</em> is coming exclusively to PS4 and PSVR this fall.</p>

<p>Recently, Google launched its latest photography-centric app, Motion Stills. Designed specifically for iOS, this app is meant to bring a slew of new features to Apple’s Live Photos format by improving the image capture and simplifying the process of sharing the resulting images.</p>
<p>Available for free in the iOS App Store, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motion-stills-create-live/id1086172168?ls=1&mt=8">Motion Stills</a> uses a clever collection of algorithms and AI to analyze the photos and data captured in the Live Photos format. Using this data and imagery, Motion Stills can process the Live Photos in a collection of creative ways.</p>
<p>Not only is Motion Stills able to stabilize the video captured before and after the still by processing the frames that are the most in-focus and detailed, it’s also capable of determining the best beginning and end point for the loop of the video.</p>
<p>Without so much as pressing a button, Motion Stills will automatically sort through your Live Photos and get all of the dirty work done behind the scenes. Below is an example clip of the stabilization feature in action:</p>
<div data-ratio="1.7778"><div><iframe height="100%" width="100%" allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unUNUKwGacY?feature=oembed"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Another problem Motion Stills covers is the lack of cross-platform support. Only recently have MacOS users been able to view Live Photos on their computers and Android support is all but nonexistent with the exception of a few third-party apps.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/apple-photo-ios-10-macos-sierra/">Apple is stepping up its Photo game with AI in iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra</a></p>
<p>Instead of relying on the unusual format, Motion Stills simplifies the process by letting you export the resulting movie clips as either a short video or animated GIF, both of which can be shared across almost any platform imaginable.</p>
<p>Apple will apparently address a few Live Photos issues in the upcoming iOS 10 update, such as Live Photos stabilization, but the video and GIF export options have yet to be mentioned at all. So, until then, it looks like Motion Stills is your best bet for making the most of your Live Photos.</p>

                            [content] => <p>Lasers, helicopters, hidden jungle cities, and ancient religions — it sounds like the synopsis to a Michael Crichton novel, but believe it or not, these things are actually the key components of some astonishing new archaeological research happening right here in the real world. With the help of an airborne lidar system, scientists recently managed to create a map of a long-lost city hidden beneath the jungle in Cambodia</p>
<p>With the special laser mounted on the underside of a helicopter, archeologists working on the project were able to compose maps revealing the massive scale of religious temples and other buildings belonging to the Khmer Empire, which was dominant in Southeast Asia from 802 AD until the 15th century. These maps were shown off for the first time this week at the Royal Geographic Society in London.</p>
<p><strong><a class="wp-image-985693" href="http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/figure_5-1449x1557.jpg"><span></span><img height="325" alt="Laser scanning map" width="303" class="wp-image-985693" src="http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/figure_5-303x325.jpg"></a>Related</strong>: <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/scanlab-self-driving-car-view/">This is what London looks like through a self-driving car’s eyes</a></p>
<p>Incredibly, the lidar system makes it possible to “look through” obstructing features such as trees and vegetation to map the ground underneath.</p>
<p>“Lidar is a revolutionary tool for archaeological survey on a landscape scale,” Dr. <a href="http://anth.uic.edu/uic-anthropology/people/faculty/mjhend">Mitch Hendrickson</a>, Assistant Professor, Department of Archaeology at the University of Chicago and a key partner in this project, told Digital Trends.</p>
<p>“The real impact of lidar is that it gives a detailed, accurate map of the ground that reveals features not clearly visible due to forest cover, or the archaeological features that leave only slight traces on the ground. It allows us to see the footprints of buildings, settlements and other infrastructure and how they intersect and change. This is the foundation for understanding community organization in the past.”</p>
<p>In short, lidar hits the “warp speed” button on painstaking archaeological work. A few hours of coverage with the groundbreaking tech achieves what literally decades of on-the-ground surveys would have been able to — and with far more accuracy to boot.</p>
<p>While it doesn’t carry out the actual excavation work itself, this is one piece of kit archaeologists are unlikely to want to leave home without from now on.</p>

In the app universe, where Apple and Android users have over three million apps to choose from and attention spans are shrinking to all time lows, the answer’s simple: Everything. While a weak name won’t necessarily spell disaster for a well-conceived product, a great name makes the all-important first impression. Here are seven common mistakes to avoid when deciding on a name for your app. 1.

<p>When the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company launched in 1946 in a sleepy suburb of Fullerton, California, little did it know how much of an imprint Fender the brand would have on the history of music.</p>
<p><span>Over 70 years, the brand has been virtually unchanged, left alone to build classic Stratocasters, Telecasters and other guitars that went out the door in search of a home. </span><span>It was a business model that was never broken, and never fixed. </span></p>

<p>When the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company launched in 1946 in a sleepy suburb of Fullerton, California, little did it know how much of an imprint Fender the brand would have on the history of music.</p>
<p><span>Over 70 years, the brand has been virtually unchanged, left alone to build classic Stratocasters, Telecasters and other guitars that went out the door in search of a home. </span><span>It was a business model that was never broken, and never fixed. </span></p>
<p>That is, until now. </p>

<p>LONDON — Seventeen seconds. That's all the time it takes for the guy in the video below to lay out a wrap, add veggies and falafel, add sauce and then wrap the whole thing up ready to serve.</p>

<p>The following wrap was prepared at I-Falafel in Petticoat Lane, London. The price is £4 ($5.65) for a large, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/4nvmgw/the_fastest_falafel_wrapper_in_london/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But in this case it isn't about the wrap. It's about the speed.</p>
<div><p><iframe height="480" width="270" allowfullscreen src="https://vid.me/e/l2mh?stats=1&tools=1"></iframe></p></div>
<p>So at that speed he could get through at least three a minute, which is 180 an hour, which over an eight-hour day would be almost one-and-a-half thousand wraps. <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/14/speed-wrapping-falafel/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Read more...</a></p>

<p>LONDON — Seventeen seconds. That's all the time it takes for the guy in the video below to lay out a wrap, add veggies and falafel, add sauce and then wrap the whole thing up ready to serve.</p>

<p>The following wrap was prepared at I-Falafel in Petticoat Lane, London. The price is £4 ($5.65) for a large, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/4nvmgw/the_fastest_falafel_wrapper_in_london/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But in this case it isn't about the wrap. It's about the speed.</p>
<div><p><iframe height="480" width="270" allowfullscreen src="https://vid.me/e/l2mh?stats=1&tools=1"></iframe></p></div>
<p>So at that speed he could get through at least three a minute, which is 180 an hour, which over an eight-hour day would be almost one-and-a-half thousand wraps. <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/14/speed-wrapping-falafel/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Read more...</a></p>

<p>If you used Google today, you probably noticed that its <a href="http://www.google.com/">doodle</a> is dedicated to Karl Landsteiner, an immunologist and pathologist who was born in Vienna on June 14th, 1868 and would have turned 148 today. Even if you’ve never heard of Landsteiner, his discoveries have affected your medical records since you were born.</p>
<p>In 1901, Landsteiner classified human blood into different groups and created the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/science/ABO-blood-group-system">ABO blood group system</a> that we still use today. His discovery, which won him the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1930/landsteiner-bio.html">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930</a>, made blood transfusion a life-saving medical practice.</p>

<p>In the 1800s, doctors knew that transfusing blood between individuals could cause red blood cells to clump — a phenomenon called agglutination. But they didn’t know why. Landsteiner discovered that agglutination is a response of the immune system.</p>
<p>He found that different blood types have different antigens, substances that stimulate an immune response. Based on the antigens, Landsteiner classified the blood groups as type A, type B, and type O. (Type AB was identified in 1902 by two of Landsteiner’s colleagues.) If a person with type A blood is given type B blood, for example, the person’s immune system will recognize the new blood cells as foreign and reject them. This immune system reaction can be fatal.</p>
<p>His discovery and classification helped make blood transfusion safe. In 1922, Landsteiner moved to <a href="http://www.rockefeller.edu/about/awards/nobel/klandsteiner#sidebar">The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</a> in New York, where he continued his work on blood groups until his death in 1943.</p>

<p>This morning, the crew of the International Space Station <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-tv-to-broadcast-us-cargo-ship-departure-from-space-station-0">will say goodbye to Orbital ATK’s Cygnus cargo capsule</a>, which has been docked to the orbiting lab for the past two and a half months. To prep the vehicle’s departure, the station's Canadian robotic arm grabbed hold of the Cygnus earlier and undocked the capsule from the Unity module. The robotic arm will hold the capsule away from the station, and release the spacecraft at 9:30AM ET. The Cygnus — which has been filled up with around 3,000 pounds of station trash — will remain in orbit around Earth for about a week before it eventually burns up in the planet’s atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p><q><span>But NASA isn't done with the vehicle quite yet</span></q></p>
<p>Just because the capsule is leaving the station doesn’t mean NASA is done with the vehicle quite yet. About five hours after the Cygnus departs the ISS — and gets far enough away — a large blaze will ignite inside the capsule’s belly. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/16/11244364/nasa-saffire-test-fire-orbital-atk-cygnus-iss-resupply-mission">It’s all part of an experiment called Saffire-I</a> meant to study how fire behaves in microgravity. A cotton-fiberglass material measuring more than 3 feet long and 1 foot wide will burn for 15 to 20 minutes inside Cygnus, creating the largest controlled fire ever in space. A suite of onboard sensors and cameras will collect data about the blaze and relay that information to NASA over the next week. That info will help the space agency come up with better ways to detect fires in space, as well as figure out how to control flames in zero G.</p>
<p>Apart from housing this science experiment, Cygnus is also responsible for deploying a couple satellites after it leaves ISS. Tomorrow morning, the capsule will let go of five Lemur-2 satellites, manufactured by satellite-maker Spire Global. These satellites will help track ships traveling in remote areas of the world’s oceans, as well as monitor weather.</p>
<p>As for the Cygnus capsule, NASA will destroy it on June 22nd. That’s when the vehicle’s engines will fire twice, taking the spacecraft out of orbit and triggering its descent toward Earth. Cygnus will then burn up somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, effectively getting rid of all the trash it has on board. Those items include broken hardware from ISS, food containers, dirty laundry, and astronaut waste, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IBg6VheqA">according to Holly Vavrin</a>, the flight lead for the current Cygnus mission.</p>
<p>NASA will also be using the capsule’s fiery death plunge as an opportunity to study how vehicles break up during atmospheric reentry. Another payload onboard Cygnus, called the ReEntry Breakup Recorder, will be taking super quick measurements of the capsule’s temperature, speed, acoustics, and more as it falls to Earth. The recorder will then help rapidly relay that data to NASA scientists on the ground before it also burns up. This should help NASA understand how spacecraft enter Earth’s atmosphere, which could be useful when designing future vehicles.</p>
<p>Live coverage of the Cygnus departure begins at 9AM ET.</p>

<p>Politicians and regulators in the European Union are finding many instances of automakers using loopholes to circumvent emissions standards. Although so far only Volkswagen has been found using software to cheat the emissions tests specified by regulators, other automakers including Jeep, General Motors, and Mercedes-Benz are taking advantage of regulatory gray areas for diesel vehicles sold in the EU, according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/business/international/volkswagen-not-alone-in-flouting-pollution-limits.html?_r=0">a report from the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <em>Times</em> noted that EU regulations allow car makers to kill the emissions control system on diesel vehicles if there's a risk that running the emissions control system could cause engine damage—“which in some cases is nearly all the time,” the paper wrote.</p>
<p>Cold weather is often cited as a reason to deactivate emissions control in the interests of extending the life of the engine (car companies in the US <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/volkswagens-emissions-cheating-scandal-has-a-long-complicated-history/">used such a justification</a> against the accusations of environmentalists as early as the 70's). But a German study found a Jeep Cherokee sold by Fiat Chrysler in Europe turned off certain emissions controls when the car experienced temperatures as high as 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Recently, an independent investigation by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/gm-says-it-misstated-fuel-economy-opel-denies-emissions-cheating-allegations/">a German environmental lobbying group, the magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em>, and a German TV program called Monitor</a> found that Opel's Zafira was turning off emissions controls at high altitude and at speeds greater than 87 mph. Opel has denied that it's done anything illegal in designing its diesel cars.</p>

This video teaches you a few tips to get some amazing shots while you’re out and about.</p><p>For the unfamiliar, a photo walk is simply when you take your camera and stroll around looking for things to photograph. There’s no specific goal in mind, and there’s no set time when you’re done. It’s just to help you explore and practice. If you go with a group, it can be even better.</p><p>The video above from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn5C6P1rxY6PEU6xUKapbCQ">Cooperative of Photography</a> offers some helpful tips on how to get the most out of a photo walk. For example, using a remote control app for your camera can let you get pictures from new angles without drawing attention to yourself from the subject. Also, try to wear dark clothes to help you avoid standing out in a crowd.</p><p>Be sure you check out our guide on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5688057/know-your-rights-ten-misconceptions-about-photography-law">your rights as a photographer</a> before you head out. While taking your photos in public spaces is legal, it’s always possible someone will get uncomfortable and approach you. As the video also points out, having cards you can hand out can be a helpful way to interact with the people around you to not only make them feel more at ease, but possibly get new fans for your work.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/w4uUjLt22gE">23 Ninja Tips For Your Next Photo Walk</a> | COOPH</p><img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/lifehacker/vip/~4/RXU9WjD3TVY">

                            [content] => <p><em>Here They Lie</em> is a psychological horror game for PlayStation VR and PlayStation 4 with a trailer that makes about as much (or little) sense as its announcement <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/06/13/here-they-lie-announced-a-surreal-horror-experience-for-ps-vr-ps4/">blog post</a> — which was posted by Cory Davis, the Co-Creative Director of the game and part of the game development studio Tangentlemen. Nonetheless, the studio employs some pretty experienced players who have taken the risk of going away from triple-a game development and start their own studio.</p>
<p>Psychological horror often comes with disturbing scenery, and this game doesn’t look like it’s breaking away from that formula. But this game incorporates that formula into virtual reality, and that is something worth getting excited over. Atmospheric games are well suited to VR, as they focus on audio and lighting, and on surprising the player in different ways. Horror is a great stage for this type of work, where every component adds to the immersive experience.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kojima-death-stranding-trailer/">First trailer of Hideo Kojima’s new game features Norman Reedus</a></p>
<p>The game has been developed in collaboration with Sony’s External Development team at Santa Monica Studio. Davis describes it as a “dark psychological horror experience that transports you to a terrifying, surreal world inhabited by strange and malevolent creatures.” Perhaps he’s referring to the creepy deer. He continues, “Unimaginable horrors lurk around every corner, just out of sight, haunting and infecting your mind.” Davis also says the game will force us to “confront the meaning” of our existence. Unlikely perhaps, but a worthwhile ambition. As such the game has a focus on narrative and dread.</p>
<p>Davis describes the birth of the new horror addition to PSVR as a rather confusing night in a Berlin techno club. Toby Gard, creator of Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider series, Rich Smith, who’s worked on the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare franchise, and John Garcia-Shelton, who’s worked on franchises like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty, somehow jointly arrived at the conclusion that they needed to make a game. That game became <em>Here They Lie</em>.</p>
<p><em>Here They Lie</em> is coming exclusively to PS4 and PSVR this fall.</p>

<p>Recently, Google launched its latest photography-centric app, Motion Stills. Designed specifically for iOS, this app is meant to bring a slew of new features to Apple’s Live Photos format by improving the image capture and simplifying the process of sharing the resulting images.</p>
<p>Available for free in the iOS App Store, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motion-stills-create-live/id1086172168?ls=1&mt=8">Motion Stills</a> uses a clever collection of algorithms and AI to analyze the photos and data captured in the Live Photos format. Using this data and imagery, Motion Stills can process the Live Photos in a collection of creative ways.</p>
<p>Not only is Motion Stills able to stabilize the video captured before and after the still by processing the frames that are the most in-focus and detailed, it’s also capable of determining the best beginning and end point for the loop of the video.</p>
<p>Without so much as pressing a button, Motion Stills will automatically sort through your Live Photos and get all of the dirty work done behind the scenes. Below is an example clip of the stabilization feature in action:</p>
<div data-ratio="1.7778"><div><iframe height="100%" width="100%" allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unUNUKwGacY?feature=oembed"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Another problem Motion Stills covers is the lack of cross-platform support. Only recently have MacOS users been able to view Live Photos on their computers and Android support is all but nonexistent with the exception of a few third-party apps.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/apple-photo-ios-10-macos-sierra/">Apple is stepping up its Photo game with AI in iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra</a></p>
<p>Instead of relying on the unusual format, Motion Stills simplifies the process by letting you export the resulting movie clips as either a short video or animated GIF, both of which can be shared across almost any platform imaginable.</p>
<p>Apple will apparently address a few Live Photos issues in the upcoming iOS 10 update, such as Live Photos stabilization, but the video and GIF export options have yet to be mentioned at all. So, until then, it looks like Motion Stills is your best bet for making the most of your Live Photos.</p>

                            [content] => <p>Lasers, helicopters, hidden jungle cities, and ancient religions — it sounds like the synopsis to a Michael Crichton novel, but believe it or not, these things are actually the key components of some astonishing new archaeological research happening right here in the real world. With the help of an airborne lidar system, scientists recently managed to create a map of a long-lost city hidden beneath the jungle in Cambodia</p>
<p>With the special laser mounted on the underside of a helicopter, archeologists working on the project were able to compose maps revealing the massive scale of religious temples and other buildings belonging to the Khmer Empire, which was dominant in Southeast Asia from 802 AD until the 15th century. These maps were shown off for the first time this week at the Royal Geographic Society in London.</p>
<p><strong><a class="wp-image-985693" href="http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/figure_5-1449x1557.jpg"><span></span><img height="325" alt="Laser scanning map" width="303" class="wp-image-985693" src="http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/figure_5-303x325.jpg"></a>Related</strong>: <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/scanlab-self-driving-car-view/">This is what London looks like through a self-driving car’s eyes</a></p>
<p>Incredibly, the lidar system makes it possible to “look through” obstructing features such as trees and vegetation to map the ground underneath.</p>
<p>“Lidar is a revolutionary tool for archaeological survey on a landscape scale,” Dr. <a href="http://anth.uic.edu/uic-anthropology/people/faculty/mjhend">Mitch Hendrickson</a>, Assistant Professor, Department of Archaeology at the University of Chicago and a key partner in this project, told Digital Trends.</p>
<p>“The real impact of lidar is that it gives a detailed, accurate map of the ground that reveals features not clearly visible due to forest cover, or the archaeological features that leave only slight traces on the ground. It allows us to see the footprints of buildings, settlements and other infrastructure and how they intersect and change. This is the foundation for understanding community organization in the past.”</p>
<p>In short, lidar hits the “warp speed” button on painstaking archaeological work. A few hours of coverage with the groundbreaking tech achieves what literally decades of on-the-ground surveys would have been able to — and with far more accuracy to boot.</p>
<p>While it doesn’t carry out the actual excavation work itself, this is one piece of kit archaeologists are unlikely to want to leave home without from now on.</p>

<p>Dove is hoping its latest commercial will make you want to call your dad this week.</p>
<p>Released just in time for Father's Day, the minute-long spot is a montage of real father-child memories in the making farmed by the brand from videos across the web (with permission from the subjects).</p>
<div><p>SEE ALSO: <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/06/15/dove-captures-the-looks-of-excitement-on-new-dads-faces/?scheme=http&utm_campaign=&utm_context=textlink&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=">See the shock and joy of men who realize they will be fathers for the first time</a></p></div>
<p>The clips are meant to showcase the innocent joy of dads finding creative ways to goof around with their kids — one surfs while his toddler daughter clings to his back, another hits the skatepark with his disabled son and a third wheels his son down a seemingly homemade roller coaster. <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/14/dove-fathers-day/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Dove is hoping its latest commercial will make you want to call your dad this week.</p>
<p>Released just in time for Father's Day, the minute-long spot is a montage of real father-child memories in the making farmed by the brand from videos across the web (with permission from the subjects).</p>
<div><p>SEE ALSO: <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/06/15/dove-captures-the-looks-of-excitement-on-new-dads-faces/?scheme=http&utm_campaign=&utm_context=textlink&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=">See the shock and joy of men who realize they will be fathers for the first time</a></p></div>
<p>The clips are meant to showcase the innocent joy of dads finding creative ways to goof around with their kids — one surfs while his toddler daughter clings to his back, another hits the skatepark with his disabled son and a third wheels his son down a seemingly homemade roller coaster. <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/06/14/dove-fathers-day/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Read more...</a></p>

<p>If you used Google today, you probably noticed that its <a href="http://www.google.com/">doodle</a> is dedicated to Karl Landsteiner, an immunologist and pathologist who was born in Vienna on June 14th, 1868 and would have turned 148 today. Even if you’ve never heard of Landsteiner, his discoveries have affected your medical records since you were born.</p>
<p>In 1901, Landsteiner classified human blood into different groups and created the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/science/ABO-blood-group-system">ABO blood group system</a> that we still use today. His discovery, which won him the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1930/landsteiner-bio.html">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930</a>, made blood transfusion a life-saving medical practice.</p>

<p>In the 1800s, doctors knew that transfusing blood between individuals could cause red blood cells to clump — a phenomenon called agglutination. But they didn’t know why. Landsteiner discovered that agglutination is a response of the immune system.</p>
<p>He found that different blood types have different antigens, substances that stimulate an immune response. Based on the antigens, Landsteiner classified the blood groups as type A, type B, and type O. (Type AB was identified in 1902 by two of Landsteiner’s colleagues.) If a person with type A blood is given type B blood, for example, the person’s immune system will recognize the new blood cells as foreign and reject them. This immune system reaction can be fatal.</p>
<p>His discovery and classification helped make blood transfusion safe. In 1922, Landsteiner moved to <a href="http://www.rockefeller.edu/about/awards/nobel/klandsteiner#sidebar">The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</a> in New York, where he continued his work on blood groups until his death in 1943.</p>

<p>This morning, the crew of the International Space Station <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-tv-to-broadcast-us-cargo-ship-departure-from-space-station-0">will say goodbye to Orbital ATK’s Cygnus cargo capsule</a>, which has been docked to the orbiting lab for the past two and a half months. To prep the vehicle’s departure, the station's Canadian robotic arm grabbed hold of the Cygnus earlier and undocked the capsule from the Unity module. The robotic arm will hold the capsule away from the station, and release the spacecraft at 9:30AM ET. The Cygnus — which has been filled up with around 3,000 pounds of station trash — will remain in orbit around Earth for about a week before it eventually burns up in the planet’s atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p><q><span>But NASA isn't done with the vehicle quite yet</span></q></p>
<p>Just because the capsule is leaving the station doesn’t mean NASA is done with the vehicle quite yet. About five hours after the Cygnus departs the ISS — and gets far enough away — a large blaze will ignite inside the capsule’s belly. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/16/11244364/nasa-saffire-test-fire-orbital-atk-cygnus-iss-resupply-mission">It’s all part of an experiment called Saffire-I</a> meant to study how fire behaves in microgravity. A cotton-fiberglass material measuring more than 3 feet long and 1 foot wide will burn for 15 to 20 minutes inside Cygnus, creating the largest controlled fire ever in space. A suite of onboard sensors and cameras will collect data about the blaze and relay that information to NASA over the next week. That info will help the space agency come up with better ways to detect fires in space, as well as figure out how to control flames in zero G.</p>
<p>Apart from housing this science experiment, Cygnus is also responsible for deploying a couple satellites after it leaves ISS. Tomorrow morning, the capsule will let go of five Lemur-2 satellites, manufactured by satellite-maker Spire Global. These satellites will help track ships traveling in remote areas of the world’s oceans, as well as monitor weather.</p>
<p>As for the Cygnus capsule, NASA will destroy it on June 22nd. That’s when the vehicle’s engines will fire twice, taking the spacecraft out of orbit and triggering its descent toward Earth. Cygnus will then burn up somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, effectively getting rid of all the trash it has on board. Those items include broken hardware from ISS, food containers, dirty laundry, and astronaut waste, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IBg6VheqA">according to Holly Vavrin</a>, the flight lead for the current Cygnus mission.</p>
<p>NASA will also be using the capsule’s fiery death plunge as an opportunity to study how vehicles break up during atmospheric reentry. Another payload onboard Cygnus, called the ReEntry Breakup Recorder, will be taking super quick measurements of the capsule’s temperature, speed, acoustics, and more as it falls to Earth. The recorder will then help rapidly relay that data to NASA scientists on the ground before it also burns up. This should help NASA understand how spacecraft enter Earth’s atmosphere, which could be useful when designing future vehicles.</p>
<p>Live coverage of the Cygnus departure begins at 9AM ET.</p>

<p>Politicians and regulators in the European Union are finding many instances of automakers using loopholes to circumvent emissions standards. Although so far only Volkswagen has been found using software to cheat the emissions tests specified by regulators, other automakers including Jeep, General Motors, and Mercedes-Benz are taking advantage of regulatory gray areas for diesel vehicles sold in the EU, according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/business/international/volkswagen-not-alone-in-flouting-pollution-limits.html?_r=0">a report from the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <em>Times</em> noted that EU regulations allow car makers to kill the emissions control system on diesel vehicles if there's a risk that running the emissions control system could cause engine damage—“which in some cases is nearly all the time,” the paper wrote.</p>
<p>Cold weather is often cited as a reason to deactivate emissions control in the interests of extending the life of the engine (car companies in the US <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/10/volkswagens-emissions-cheating-scandal-has-a-long-complicated-history/">used such a justification</a> against the accusations of environmentalists as early as the 70's). But a German study found a Jeep Cherokee sold by Fiat Chrysler in Europe turned off certain emissions controls when the car experienced temperatures as high as 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Recently, an independent investigation by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/gm-says-it-misstated-fuel-economy-opel-denies-emissions-cheating-allegations/">a German environmental lobbying group, the magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em>, and a German TV program called Monitor</a> found that Opel's Zafira was turning off emissions controls at high altitude and at speeds greater than 87 mph. Opel has denied that it's done anything illegal in designing its diesel cars.</p>

This video teaches you a few tips to get some amazing shots while you’re out and about.</p><p>For the unfamiliar, a photo walk is simply when you take your camera and stroll around looking for things to photograph. There’s no specific goal in mind, and there’s no set time when you’re done. It’s just to help you explore and practice. If you go with a group, it can be even better.</p><p>The video above from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn5C6P1rxY6PEU6xUKapbCQ">Cooperative of Photography</a> offers some helpful tips on how to get the most out of a photo walk. For example, using a remote control app for your camera can let you get pictures from new angles without drawing attention to yourself from the subject. Also, try to wear dark clothes to help you avoid standing out in a crowd.</p><p>Be sure you check out our guide on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5688057/know-your-rights-ten-misconceptions-about-photography-law">your rights as a photographer</a> before you head out. While taking your photos in public spaces is legal, it’s always possible someone will get uncomfortable and approach you. As the video also points out, having cards you can hand out can be a helpful way to interact with the people around you to not only make them feel more at ease, but possibly get new fans for your work.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/w4uUjLt22gE">23 Ninja Tips For Your Next Photo Walk</a> | COOPH</p><img height="1" alt="" width="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/lifehacker/vip/~4/RXU9WjD3TVY">
